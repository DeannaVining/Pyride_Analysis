# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview of the Analysis
  The purpose of this analysis is to dissect the trends of Pyber in the different city types (rural, suburban, and urban). We will be looking at a breakdown table of the average fares, and a chart describing the differences in monetary income for the comapany.
  
##  Results
The chart created shows that the average fare cost per ride is significantly more expensive in the more rural areas, and drops as we get closer to the urban areas. The same can be said for the average fare per driver.

Do note that the total amount of money gained in fares is much higher in the urban area in comparison to the rural (suburan being inbetween on total and the average).

The chart below indicates that per week there is in general about 4-5 times more money made from urban fares than rural fares, again with suburban fares being right inbetween.

## Summary
  1) I highly suggest keeping up the pace on the urban side of things, as it is by far your biggest source of income.
  2) It is worth looking into a further analysis of the suburban/ rural communities. With the per fare costs being as high as they are, there may be a benefit to growing the organization.
  3) I suggest an analysis that may focus on what the fares in the rural areas consist of, and how much competition there is/ what figures they are making. Expanding traffic in these areas could potentially be quite lucrative.
